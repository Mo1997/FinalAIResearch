Bike Sharing Data evaluated using regression models on hourly bike rentals

Bike sharing systems are the next generation of bike rentals as the entire process from membership to rental and returns has become automated and more efficient. Through such systems users are able to easily rent a bike from one spot and return it at any other position. Bike sharing data is therefore very key in monitoring the total number of bikes being rented during each hour of the day. This would help improve the system and number of bikes for rental. As such this research focuses on creating a model that would best predict the number of bikes rented per hour. The research compared three regression models, linear regression, ridge regression and lightgbm. Amongst these models lightgbm was chosen as the best model and evaluated using unseen data. The results produced an accuracy of %86 for new unseen data.
